# Exploring the evolution of technologies and innovations over the last decade in an attempt to visualize our recent tech history

We live in a very interesting time. Due to advances in technology, our world is constantly changing. For my final project at Metis, I went on an adventure to visualize our recent tech history to spot existing trends and to, hopefully, identify emerging ones. 
I also was curious to see whether I would be able to find any patterns in how varous technologies develop and to answer the questions on why some technologies develop rapidly while others take their time.

To collect data, I scaped TechCrunch and Venturebeat, the two leading tech news outlets. At that, I followed a mothodology outlined in a blog post by [MonkeyLearn](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/filtering-startup-news-machine-learning/)

The only adjustment I've made to their spiders is to add a field for "Author", a new piece data I plan to use in one of my future projects.
